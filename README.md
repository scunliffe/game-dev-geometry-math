# game-dev-geometry-math
A Collection of Game Dev Geometry based snippets

## Why?

When I started building games in Unity (C#) I found myself needing many functions to calculate common geometry functions.
I was hoping such a repo existed somewhere, and I could just use it, but I didn't find one.
So I wanted to collect the best, optimized examples from the Internet/experts... and organize them for fellow developers that might want to use them.

Although my focus here is in C#, for Unity development, if this is of any value to others, I will add C++, Java/Kotlin, Python examples as well.

## Key Desired Methods

### 2D
 1. Determine which side of a line (2D) a point is on
 2. Determine if a point is inside a (2D) shape (rectangle, triangle, circle, polygon)
 3. Determine the centroid of a (2D) shape (rectangle, triangle, circle, polygon)

### 3D
 1. Determine if a point is within a (3D) shape (rectangular prism, sphere, cone, cylinder)
 2. Determine which side of (3D) plane a point is on
 3. Determine the midpoint of a line
 4. Determine if a point is on a line (with a fuzz factor)
